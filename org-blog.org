* Blogging using just org-mode and github-pages
/Wed July 22nd 2015/

When I'm writing something, I want to just open up a window (or emacs buffer) and start writing. I don't want to have to worry about whether or not I have a net connection, or whether Jekyll/Octopress/Pelikan/whatever is synced with the git repo properly. I want to be able to blog from multiple machines without going through all the madness that Octopress etc involve.

That's why I decided to migrate my blog to the simplest format possible: just plain org-mode. A single command generates the html from inside emacs. I have a simple CSS style, using default fonts. It looks nice, and loads fast. Publishing to github pages is hella easy. So now I have a dead simple, freely hosted blog/web page. Writing blog posts is now somehow less intimidating.
