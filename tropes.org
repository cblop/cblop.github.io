* Describing Tropes With Interval Temporal Logic

(Work in progress)

Taking popular examples from the [[http://www.designthroughstorytelling.net/periodic/][Periodic Table of Storytelling]] (derived from [[http://tvtropes.org][TVTropes]]), and describing them using Interval Temporal Logic.

TVTropes has the concept of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnipresentTropes][Omnipresent Tropes]], which are tropes that are ubiquitous to storytelling. I try to cover most of them here, as well as some less vital but common tropes.

** Story structure
*** Plot
A plot is a series of events. Must have:

- cause and effect (physics)
- emotional motivation (biology), and
- reason (logic and ethics)

If it doesn't have these, then a plot hole is the result (or in our case, the plot is unsatisfiable).

*** Conflict
[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conflict]]

Arthur Quiller-Couch says there are seven kinds of conflict creating seven basic plots:
1. Man vs Man
2. Man vs Self
3. Man vs Nature
4. Man vs Society
5. Man vs God/Fate
6. Man caught in the middle of other characters/conflicts
7. Male and female
8. Man vs machine (added as an extension)

Could just be boiled down to the first three ("Man" is defeatable, "nature" is to be survived or changed rather than defeated).

So, taking just the first three:

\(
\mathit{conflict(X, Y)}\land
[B] (\mathit {problem(X, Y})\land
\langle E \rangle \mathit{resolution(problem(X, Y))}
\)

...where $X$ is "entityA" and $Y$ can be "entityA", "entityB" or "nature".

(consider replacing "problem" here with "inciting incident")

*** Three Act Structure
[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeActStructure]]
- Setup, confrontation, resolution
- (leads to a climax in the third act)
- Setup is [[Call to Adventure]], or just an [[Inciting Incident]]
- In confrontation, protagonist and antagonist must clash or obstacles must be faced
- Resolution contains [[Climax]] and [[Dénouement]].

\(
\mathit{setup(X, Y) \land (\mathit{callToAdventure(X)} \lor \mathit{incitingIncident(X)})}
\)

\(
\mathit{confrontation(X, Y)} \land [D] (\mathit{fight (X, Y)} \lor \mathit{struggle (X)})
\)

\(
\mathit{resolution(Z) \land [E] Z}
\)

\(
\mathit{threeActStructure(X, Y)} \land
[B] \mathit{setup (X, Y)} \land
[D] \mathit{confrontation (X, Y)} \land
[E] \mathit{resolution (setup(X, Y))}
\)

(And consider replacing "confrontation" here with "conflict", as above)

(and "resolution" with "climax", as below)

(also: "setup" could be the "inciting incident", below)

*** Climax
[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClimax]]

- Must have [[Three Act Structure]]
- [[Conflict]] must be resolved by the third act
- [[Dénouement]] must occur to explain loose ends
- Climax can be some sort of big fight between protagonist and antagonist
- Type of climax depends on the genre and the setup
- For example, the protagonist and antagonist could fight over the [[MacGuffin]]
- Or the detective could solve the murder mystery
- I suggest just having this as a necessary component of [[Three Act Structure]]

Simply describe it as a list of types of climax (fight between protagonist and antagonist, solving of the murder, etc)

\(
\mathit{climax} \land [D] (\mathit{fight (X, Y)} \lor
\mathit{struggle (X)})
\)

*** Dénouement
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Denouement

The aftermath of the action, where loose ends are tied up.

It could be:

- happy ending
- consequences of a tragic ending (funeral of the hero, for example)
- more examples in the tvtropes page


*** MacGuffin
[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin]]

/A motivating element in a story that is used to drive the plot/

The Maltese falcon, the holy grail, the briefcase of money, the Golden Fleece, etc. A MacGuffin must be:

- interchangeable. It could be anything, it just happens to be whatever it is in the story.
- Not used in the story. If it does something and is used, it's a [[Plot Device]], not a MacGuffin.

It seems that MacGuffins are always parts of [[Quest]]s. Is a quest a type of [[Conflict]], that's only resolved by the retrieval of a MacGuffin?

\(
\mathit{macguffinQuest} \land [B] \mathit{loss (macguffin)} \land [E] \mathit{find (macguffin)}
\)

*** Quest
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuest

A quest must have a hero (and supporters), travelling in search of something. Could be a [[MacGuffin]], to defeat the antagonist, or to rescue someone. Or all of these.

See [[MacGuffin]] above.

\(
\mathit{defeatQuest} \land [B] \mathit{find (Antogonist)} \land [E] (\mathit{defeat (Antagonist)} \lor \mathit{defeat(Protagonist)}))
\)

\(
\mathit{rescueQuest} \land [B] \mathit{find (Rescuee)} \land [E] \mathit{rescue (Rescuee)}
\)

\(
\mathit{quest} \land [D] (\mathit{macguffinQuest} \lor \mathit{defeatQuest} \lor \mathit{rescueQuest})
\)

*** The Reveal
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal

The resolution of a twist. The audience is given new information which has been withheld to create suspense.

This is a key trope in murder mysteries. In that case, you know that there's a mystery to be solved, and it's solved by the end. Other times, the reveal is a shock (like the endings of /The Empire Strikes Back/ and /Fight Club/).

\(
\mathit{secret(father(Darth, Luke))} \land [E] \mathit{reveal (father(Darth, Luke))}
\)

** Setting/location
*** Inciting Incident
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncitingIncident

The first thing that sets in motion the sequence of events that form the plot. Ideally, it should foreshadow what the [[Climax]] will be like.

If it's part of a quest story, the inciting incident would be the [[Call to Adventure]].

*** Call to Adventure
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallToAdventure


First step on Campbell's [[Hero's Journey]]. The hero discovers that he must leave the known world behind and go forth to unknown places.

If a hero initially rejects the call, they usually end up worse off for it.

*** Hero's Journey
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHerosJourney

Can be boiled down to three stages:

1. Departure (hero leaves familiar world behind)
2. Initiation (hero learns to navigate the unfamiliar world of adventure)
3. Return: the Hero returns to the familiar world

There's more to it than that (see below), but we shouldn't be concerned with that for now.

This is analogous to the three parts of the [[Three Act Structure]], so can be seen as a variation on that.

Call to adventure --(supernatural aid)--> Threshold Guardian -->
Threshold (between the known and unknown) --(challenges: helper, mentor, temptation)-->
REVELATION: Abyss death & rebirth-->Transformation-->Atonement-->
Return-->Call to adventure again
