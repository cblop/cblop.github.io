            Last week I had an out-of-the-blue meeting with <a href="http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/~jjb/">Joanna Bryson</a> to discuss the overlaps in our research. We both did stuff with emotional models for agents, but it was pretty tangential for both of us.
          </p>

          <p>
            The conversation turned to how I might go about commercialising my research. I'd had a conversation with some guys at a business incubator that suggested I hold back publication of my ideas in order to hold on to intellectual property that could attract investors. She advocated the opposite: publishing as much of my research as possible in order to build up a reputation for myself. Additionally, she said I should focus my effort on turning my research into a game. Then she posed me a question: "<i>Well, what is it you want to do with your life?</i>".
          </p>

          <p>
            I paused for a few seconds and responded: "<i>I want to create something new and original</i>". It's funny how strange it was to be asked that question. I don't think anyone has asked me that before! It jarred me for a moment, and I felt a little ashamed that I couldn't reply immediately with a response. I mean, don't all successful and ambitious people have this question at the back of their mind every day when they wake up? But when I relaxed and contemplated my answer, it seemed obvious.
          </p>

            I'm about to reach a point in my life where I have a huge decision to make. What do I want to do after I've graduated from the EngD? The way I see it, my options are:
          </p>

          <ol class="org-ol">
            <li>To get funding to make a game full-time based on my research
            </li>
            <li>To go and do a post-doc in Japan
            </li>
            <li>To commercialise my research with a startup incubator
            </li>
            <li>To get a development job here in Bristol, and save money for 1. or 3.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            There's no reason I can't do number 1. in my free time while pursuing one of the other options. And in fact, I am, by working on small games now and putting them on my website. But to make a decent game will take my full-time commitment, and for that I need enough money to at least cover my living costs. That means either saving up enough, or getting funding.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm glad Joanna asked me that question. Until last week, I'd been unsure what to do next. But being asked what I wanted to do with my life forced me to make my choice. Though my next step might be unclear, I know where I want it to take me eventually.
