<i>Thu Jul 14th 2016</i>

<p>
As part of my EngD course, I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to collaborate with the <a href="http://www.bishopspalace.org.uk/">Bishops' Palace</a> in Wells on a proof-of-concept tour guide prototype. The tour guide is to be presented to visitors through a tablet device as they walk around the palace grounds.
</p>

<p>
Its presentation was a little unusual: rather than simply presenting facts in a linear manner, they are presented in the form of a story that changes and adapts according to the actions of the visitor (such as where they go, what questions they ask and what they look at).
</p>

<p>
The game took the form of a Japanese-style "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel">visual novel</a>", where the player wanders around examining items and asking questions to characters. I cut out pictures of the bishops from their paintings to use as the character avatars. Background images were simple photos of rooms in the palace.
</p>

<p>
The visitors' location is triangulated based on their position relative to bluetooth LE radio beacons placed thoughout the rooms. These beacons (also known as iBeacons) simply emit a constant radio signal, and a device's position can be calculated based on the strengths of multiple beacon signals.

<p>
The created system was only a proof-of-concept, but a fun one nonetheless. The eventual aim is to integrate it with the instition/social norm system described in my <a href="./punch-judy.html">Punch and Judy post</a> so that each character's actions follow a consistent narrative. For now, the story has been manually written, updating a visitor's location in the game based on their physical location.

<p>
My eventual aim is to create a similar system that can be accessed online (minus the BLE location sensing, clearly), where authors can create their own non-linear narratives quickly and easily based on story tropes from the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/">TV Tropes</a> website, and play the generated visual novel. Right now, I'm working on the browser-based "StoryBuilder" authoring system that uses a domain specific language to describe story tropes. The next blog post will describe that system in more detail - when it's ready!
